        <h2>My Review</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, Adrift is an extraordinary novel that skillfully blends suspense and emotion. Coral’s journey of survival on the island is both thrilling and inspiring, while Isa’s determination adds a layer of heartfelt devotion. Bambi, the loyal dog, enhances the story with his endearing presence, though I wish his role had been slightly expanded. I would rate this book a 9.9 out of 10, as it excels in nearly every aspect, delivering a compelling narrative that resonates deeply. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a powerful read.</p>
